# Communicate Data Findings.

# Overview:

This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choosing. You will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships, but it does not need to be clean or perfect. There is no one single answer that needs to come out of a given dataset. This part of the project is your opportunity to ask questions of the data and make your own discoveries. It’s important to keep in mind that sometimes exploration can lead to dead ends, and that it can take multiple steps to dig down to what you’re truly looking for. Be patient with your steps, document your work carefully, and be thorough in the perspective that you choose to take with your dataset.

In the second part, you will take your main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, you will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate your results. This part of the project should make heavy use of the first part of the project. Select one or two major paths in your exploration, choose relevant visualizations along that path, and then polish them to construct a story for your readers to understand what you found.

## Step 1.1: Choose your Dataset:

- Ford GoBike System Data

The Data
Each trip is anonymized and includes:
Trip Duration (seconds)
Start Time and Date
End Time and Date
Start Station ID
Start Station Name
Start Station Latitude
Start Station Longitude
End Station ID
End Station Name
End Station Latitude
End Station Longitude
Bike ID
User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)

# Step 1.2: Explore Your Data
It’s time to get to the interesting bits. Explore your data and document your findings in a report. The report should briefly introduce the dataset, then systematically walk through the points of exploration that you conducted. You should have headers and text that organize your thoughts and findings. Visualizations in this part of the project need not be completely polished: this is just your own exploration at this point. However, you should still make sure that you adhere to principles of using appropriate plot types and encodings so that accurate conclusions can be drawn, and that you have enough comments and labeling so that when you return to your work, you can quickly grasp your analysis steps.

If you use a Jupyter Notebook for this step of the project, don’t forget to export the notebook as an html file for the project submission.

Step 2.1: Document your Story
At the end of your exploration, you probably have a bunch of things that you’ve discovered. Now it’s time to organize your findings and select a story that you will convey to others. In your readme document, you should summarize your main findings and reflect on the steps you took in your data exploration. You should also lay out the key insights that you want to convey in your explanatory report as well as any changes to visualizations, or note new visualizations that will be created to bridge between your insights.

# Step 2.2: Create your Slide Deck
Follow the plans you laid out in the previous step and create a slide deck with explanatory data visualizations to tell a story about the data you explored. You can start with code that you used in your exploration, but you should make sure that the code is revised so that your plots are polished. Make sure that you also pay attention to aspects of design integrity in your revisions.
